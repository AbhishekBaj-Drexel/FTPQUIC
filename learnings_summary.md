## Insights Gained from the Implementation

- **Supporting Multiple Clients**:
  - A new asynchronous task is spawned for each incoming connection, enabling concurrent handling of multiple clients. This concurrency was not covered in the Part 2 analysis.

- **Robust Checksum Verification**:
  - The code includes a full checksum validation step to ensure file integrity during transfer. In Part 2, checksums were only mentioned briefly without implementation details.

- **Enhanced Logging and Debugging**:
  - Logging statements are scattered throughout the code to track execution flow and quickly identify issues. Such diagnostic logging was absent from the Part 2 analysis.

- **Streamlined Certificate Management**:
  - The README and code outline clear steps for generating and loading TLS certificates to secure QUIC connections. Certificate setup was not detailed in the Part 2 analysis.

- **Clear Separation of Client and Server Roles**:
  - Client and server functionality live in separate modules, each with its own setup and instructions. This distinction was not made explicit in Part 2.

- **User-Friendly File Prompting**:
  - The client interactively prompts for a filename at runtime, making it easy to confirm the file exists before uploading. Part 2 did not include this interactive approach.
